The Gitflow Workflow defines a strict branching model designed around the project release. This provides a robust framework for managing larger projects. Gitflow is ideally suited for projects that have a scheduled release cycle. This workflow doesn’t add any new concepts or commands beyond what’s required for the Feature Branch Workflow. Instead, it assigns very specific roles to different branches and defines how and when they should interact. ### Git RepositoryA Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed. #####Initializing a new repository: git initTo create a new repo, you'll use the git init command. git init is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repo. Executing this command will create a new .git subdirectory in your current working directory. This will also create a new master branch. #####Usage1.  Create a project folder that you would like to create a repo within. You'll first cd to the root project folder and then execute the git init command. Command:  git init 2. Transform the current directory into a Git repository. This adds a .git subdirectory to the current directory and makes it possible to start recording revisions of the project Command:  git init <directory> ### Git Clonegit clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. git clone is primarily used to point to an existing repo and make a clone or copy of that repo at in a new directory, at another location. The original repository can be located on the local filesystem or on remote machine accessible supported protocols. Command: git clone <url>$ git clone https://github.com/hs434/mini_project_1_hrk.git### ForkA fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. Forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea. Instead of using a single server-side repository to act as the “central” codebase, it gives every developer their own server-side repository.The main advantage of the Forking Workflow is that contributions can be integrated without the need for everybody to push to a single central repository. Developers push to their own server-side repositories, and only the project maintainer can push to the official repository. This allows the maintainer to accept commits from any developer without giving them write access to the official codebase.#####Propose changes to someone else's projectA great example of using forks to propose changes is for bug fixes. Rather than logging an issue for a bug you've found, you can:- Fork the repository.- Make the fix.- Submit a pull request to the project owner.If the project owner likes your work, they might pull your fix into the original repository.### Git BranchA Git branch is essentially an independent line of development. You can take advantage of branching when working on new features or bug fixes because it isolates your work from that of other team members. The "branch" command helps you create, delete, and list branches.Different branches can be merged into any one branch as long as they belong to the same repository.Command: git branch <branch name>###Git CommitThe "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. It captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes. Committed snapshots can be thought of as “safe” versions of a project—Git will never change them unless you explicitly ask it to. Prior to the execution of git commit, The **git add** command is used to promote or 'stage' changes to the project that will be stored in a commit. #####Important Options **-m <message>**  Sets the commit's message. Make sure to provide a concise description that helps your teammates (and yourself) understand what happened.Command: git commit -m "commit message"**-a**  Includes all currently changed files in this commit. Keep in mind, however, that untracked (new) files are not included.Command: git commit -a**--amend**  Rewrites the very last commit with any currently staged changes and/or a new commit message. Git will rewrite the last commit and effectively replace it with the amended one. Note that such a rewriting of commits should only be performed on commits that have not been pushed to a remote repository, yet.Command: git commit --amend###Git MergeThe git merge command lets you take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch. git merge is used to combine two branchesCommand: git merge <branch name>
