﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿## **Static:**Static means, that the member is on a class level rather on the instance level. Static variables exist only in single instance per class and are not instantiated. If a static variable is changed in one instance of the class, the change will affect its value in all other instances.In Python we can declare:- Static Method [More Info](https://www.journaldev.com/18722/python-static-method)- Static Variable [More Info](https://radek.io/2011/07/21/static-variables-and-methods-in-python/)Example:class Calculator:    # create addNumbers static method    @staticmethod    def multiplyNums(x, y):        return x + yprint('Product:', Calculator.multiplyNums(15, 110))
