﻿## **Attribute:**An attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object.[More info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/class-instance-attributes-python/)
