﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿## **Attribute:**An attribute is a specification that defines a property of an object, element, or file. It may also refer to or set the specific value for a given instance of such. For clarity, attributes should more correctly be considered metadata.A class attribute is a Python variable that belongs to a class rather than a particular object.[More info](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/class-instance-attributes-python/)**Example:**Let’s use a Python class example to illustrate the difference. Here, **class_var** is a class attribute, and **i_var** is an instance attribute:class MyClass(object):    class_var = 1    def __init__(self, i_var):        self.i_var = i_var
