# Introduction to Linux and Vi

Ever wondered what text editor to use while using command line? If you faced this situation, don't worry, Vi is here to help!

First, let's start with Linux.

## History of Linux

Linus Torvalds created a project while studying computer science at University of Helsinki in 1991, which later became the Linux kernel. He wrote the program specifically for the hardware he was using and independent of an operating system because he wanted to use the functions of his new PC with an 80386 processor.

Hence the birth of Linux, which is now used by most of the Fortune 500 companies.

## Linux Commands

Now let's see some of the popular Linux commands which will help you perform the basic tasks on a Linux terminal:

**cd:**

This command is used to change directories. For example, in order to change to directory "linux2", use the following command:

`$> cd linux2`

**mkdir:**

This command is used to create new  directories. For example, in order to create a new directory "linux3", use the following command:

`$> mkdir linux3`

**cp:**

This command is used to copy files and directories from one place to another. The format is always

`$> cp <source> <destination>`

For example, in order to copy the file linux4.md into the folder linux5, use the following command:

`$> cp linux4.md linux5`

*Bonus:* You can use this command to rename files. 

Eg.: In order to rename a file abc.txt to def.txt, use the following command:

`$> cp abc.txt def.txt`

**pwd:**

This command is used to print the working directory. It is useful to know the current path or working directory and helps when lost! 

Use the following syntax:

```
$> pwd

/Users/kaustav/class601/mini_project_1_hrk 
```
